      "scenario": "Enterprise accounts payable invoice discrepancy (duplicate/fee ambiguity). Seed an environment using Gmail + Airtable + Linear. Gmail: Create a thread with 2 emails. Email #1 is from vendor billing (Apex Cloud Services) to Accounts Payable with subject containing an Invoice ID and PO number, and language like “urgent / overdue / pay today”. Body must include: invoice ID, PO number, billed amount, due date, and a short justification for an extra “support fee” line item added after the PO was issued. Email #2 is a terse internal reply from AP/Finance to the vendor stating the invoice may be a duplicate and requesting clarification + remittance details. Airtable: Seed records so there is (a) an existing invoice that could plausibly match (same PO, similar invoice ID/amount, prior month), and (b) a Payments/Remittances-style record showing AP already paid something related (full or partial). Make it ambiguous but solvable. Linear: Provide a “Finance Ops/AP” project/team ready to receive a new issue; do not pre-create the issue",
