The rate limiting mentions \"per API key\" - does this mean per application or per user?\n3. I noticed the webhook signature verification example uses HMAC-SHA256. Is this mandatory or can we use other algorithms?\n\nAlso, could you add an example for pagination? The docs mention it but don't show how to use the cursor parameter.\n\nThanks!\nMike",

I'll add a note about this in the docs.\n\n2. Rate limiting - It's per API key, which maps to per application. Each app gets 1000 requests/hour. If you need user-level limits, we have a separate enterprise tier.\n\n3. HMAC-SHA256 is mandatory for security reasons. We require this to ensure webhook authenticity.\n\nGood catch on pagination! I'll add a comprehensive example with cursor-based pagination by end of day.\n\nAnything else?\n\nBest,\nSarah",
